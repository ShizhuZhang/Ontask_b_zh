The Top Menu
============

OnTask assumes that you will be working with one workflow. The first screen (the one that appears when you log in or when you click in the *Workflows* link in the top menu) shows you the workflows available. To start working with one of them you have to *Open* it. Once you open a workflow, the following options are available in the the top menu with the following links:

.. sidebar:: Superuser

   If your account has *superuser* or *admin* priviledges, the top menu will include the additional option with name *SQL Connections*. This functionality allows the administrator to manage a collection of connections to SQL relational databases. These connections are available to instructors as part of the operations to Upload/Merge data into the table.
